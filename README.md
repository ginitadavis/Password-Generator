# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This webpage is a password generator. The challenge provided a starter code that I copied from a repository, and I created the password generator function that first gets the user's inputs through a series of windows alerts asking what criteria the user wants for their password, and based on the user's answers, the function adds the chosen elements into a variable. Then I randomly get elements from the variable and that is display to the user. I also added validations in case the user does not follow the webpade's guide and either enters numbers outside the scope, or enters a letter or a symbol instead of a number.

My motivation was to start getting comfortable programming in javascript. I also wanted to be able to develop my own code and start thinking as a programmer.

## Usage

![alt text](assets/images/Main-screen.png)

The page will have a non-editable text box and a button. After clicking the Generate Password button, there will be a prompt that will ask to enter a length between 8 and 128 characters. If the user enters a letter or a symbol, there will a validation asking to enter a number. If the number entered is outside the said parameters, there will be another validation asking the user to enter a valid number. After that, the webpage will ask if the user wants to add uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. The user can choose what to add and then the webpage will show the password in the textbox.
